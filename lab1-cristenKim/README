Lab 1

This submission is for the design problem for lab 1B. 
All the options specified will work, except --profile, and we implemented
the additional capability of waiting on one specified process by giving wait
an optional argument.

This optional argument is the command number that the user would like to wait
on. The first command is index 0. 

This implementation requires that the user close the appropriate pipe file 
descriptors before calling wait, since wait cannot close all the pipe file
descriptors since it is no longer guaranteed to be the last option. 

We saved the pipe file descriptors in a separate array so that the we could
close the unused end of the pipe when a child process was forked, but this
version did not work (it is currently commented out) so we closed all file
descriptors in the child process instead.

Our testing is in test.sh, which can be invoked using "make check".

We implemented the Makefile such that the user can use "make", "make check",
"make clean", "make dist" as specified in the spec. There are currently
no tests run for "make dist".
