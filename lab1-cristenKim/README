Lab 1

This submission is for lab 1B, which is the second part of lab 1. 
All the options specified will work, except --profile.

It can be built using make, and run using ./simpsh 

For our implementation of wait, --wait must be the last option specified because
it will close all of the pipes, to solve the infinite waiting problem.
This is not ideal, but the alternative of requiring the user to close the
correct file descriptors before calling wait is also not ideal. 

We saved the pipe file descriptors in a separate array so that the we could
close the unused end of the pipe when a child process was forked.

Our testing is in test.sh, which can be invoked using "make check".

We implemented the Makefile such that the user can use "make", "make check",
"make clean", "make dist" as specified in the spec. There are currently
no tests run for "make dist".
