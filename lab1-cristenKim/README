Lab 1

This submission is for the design problem for lab 1B. 
All the options specified will work, except --profile, and we implemented
the additional capability of waiting on one specified process by giving wait
an optional argument. Because the argument is optional, it must be invoked
using --wait=N, where N is the index of the command to be waited for. The 
first command is referenced at index 0. 

This implementation requires that the user close the appropriate pipe file 
descriptors before calling wait, since wait cannot close all the pipe file
descriptors since it is no longer guaranteed to be the last option. 

Our testing is in test.sh, which can be invoked using "make check".

We implemented the Makefile such that the user can use "make", "make check",
"make clean", "make dist" as specified in the spec.
