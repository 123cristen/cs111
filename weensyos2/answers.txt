Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: round robin


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
(320*4 + 320*4 - 1 + 320*4 - 2 + 320*4 - 3) / 4 = 1278.5 ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
(320 + 640 + 960 + 1280) / 4 = 800 ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
(0 + 1 + 2 + 3) / 4 = 1.5 ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
(0 + 320 + 640 + 960)/4 = 480 ms

Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?
Both were completed. Priorities and shares were assigned using macros, 
they can be reassigned using system calls if necessary.

Exercise 5:
The first clock timer interrupt took place during process 4. Process 3 finished execution, and was
printed out to the screen, so process 4 should be next in the round robin.
However, it was interrupted before it could print, and schedule() was called
after the interrupt. schedule() moves on to the next process, so process 1
received its turn again instead of finishing process 4.
