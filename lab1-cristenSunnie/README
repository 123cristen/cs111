Lab 1

This submission is for lab 1a, which is the first part of lab 1.

It can be built using make, and run using ./simpsh 

We have implemented the --wronly, --rdonly, --command, and 
--verbose flags using the appropriate commands as outlined
in the specification on the class website.

Our testing is in test.sh, which can be invoked using "make check".

We implemented the Makefile such that the user can use "make", "make check",
"make clean", "make dist" as specified in the spec.
